	* 08_1.cpp 		// Simulation code, samples using Metropolis algorithm
				// the quantum approximate ground state wave function of
				// a particle in a 1D quartic potential.
				// Saves positions visited during the walk and progressive
				// energy average. Needs "block_stat.h" library to estimate
				// block average and "random_walk.h" library to implement the 
				// random walk with Metropolis acceptance of moves
				// Can receive \mu and \sigma parameters from command line


- launcher.sh			// Launches subsequent simulations in which passes from command 
				// line different values of \mu and \sigma parameters for the 
				// wave function. Needs starting and ending value of both \mu and 
				// \sigma with the number of intermediate steps to make.
