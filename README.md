# LSN_Andrea_Caprotti
Repository for the submission of the exercises for the Numerical Simulation Laboratory by prof. D.E. Galli @ Physics Unimi.
Each subfolder contains C++ code folder, final data folder and Jupyter Notebook with data elaboration and comments on the results obtained.
Code needs g++ compiler, --std=c++11 version. Each code folder (except for lez_10/10_2, lez11 and lez_12 -the latter do not contain any C++ code) 
contains makefile for compilation. 

Additinonal libraries are all refered to "libraries" repository, so code should compile even if these libraries are not present in the single repository;
if compilation presents issues, please copy libraries in code folder and change the relative position of the libraries in the .cpp and .hpp files.
