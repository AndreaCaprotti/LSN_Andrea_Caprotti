	* 10_1.cpp 		// Simulation code, finds a solution for the Travelling Salesman
				// problem using a Simulated Annealing Algorithm. Essentially an 
				// adapted version of the genetic algorithm, uses one single 
				// Chromosome from "chromosome.h", varied using only mutations.
				// Can receive inverse of temperature from command line for 
				// acceptance probability and adapts number of steps as \beta^(3/2)
				// Final route appended to file with temperature. Also needs 
				// "random.h" library to generate random variables 

- launcher.sh			// Launches subsequent simulations in which passes from command 
				// line the temperature; final data is gathered in same data file
