	* 10_2.cpp 		// Simulation code, adaptation of 09_1.cpp code, which adds the 
				// possibility of exchanging a number of the best routes with other 
				// 3 parallel executions of the same code to speed up the 
				// execution. Needs "random.h", "chromosome.h" and MPI to correctly 
				// execute. Compiled using mpic++. Also needs Primes datafile to 
				// start off different random sequences.
